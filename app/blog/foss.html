                    <h3><strong>vc</strong> is open source now!</h3>
                    <p>
                        My original intention with <strong>vc</strong> was to open
                        source it. Before I did that, however, I wanted to see what
                        potential there was to get rich off the finished products by
                        doing NFTs. I have now had enough experience of what it would
                        take to make a satisfactory conclusion, viz. that it sucks
                        and I hate it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am, therefore, effective immediately, open sourcing the
                        <strong>vc</strong> codebase.
                    </p>

            <%= require('../partials/footer.html?raw') %>
